            Sorry for not making statement be clear today. However, This is all true long story of my life, which you might not believe, but I swear to god 
It is true and I might feel embarrassing to expose how I feel but gotta tell ya everything.
</br></br></br></br>
So.. As I told, when I was in middle school, 
I wanted to help other people. I imagined myself 
to go to Africa and help young black people.
(Since I had no experiences, I thought they are
only people who’re suffered lol) That idea has never got out of my heart. 
<span><hr></hr>I remembered that I told to my boyfriend to see if we share same value for life “have you ever thought going Africa to help people?” I don’t remember the answer, must’ve told negative<hr></hr></span>
</br></br></br></br>
Then I went to college and I joined the social-entreprenuership business club. Basically, When
we start a project, the first things we had to
make sure was the people in needs and self-motivation
<span><hr></hr>We let them know “how to catch a fish” instead of being free voluteer and tell them “go fetch it yourself”<hr></hr></span>That was the time when I changed my straregy to achieve my ultimate goal. I let my self dig more in design skills, learning technologies, business management skills etc.
</br></br></br></br>
When I was about to finish the college. The belief dragged me to come to new york. Why New York? There were couple of reasons. First, It’s easy for me to get a job. Also, there is United Nations which I wanted to be a part of. Because I thought that is the place to make lots money with good compensation, welfare by helping people. (Since I was in a business club, Still I cared about money) 
</br></br></br></br>
Later on, turned out it is not easy for me to get in UN. I realized I should've prepared it early on. There were more oppurtunity for people who is part of political, business, financial, public information. There were small chances for a designer, which was difficult to go through as a foreigner.
</br></br></br></br>
Then I got lost my desires and just worked and made money and had fun. That went around forever.
</br></br></br></br>
In the middle of time when I was preparing for advanced school of art+technology, I met Angelica in a class.  Never knew she would speak something in my mind. 
</br></br></br></br>
I was so happy to meet her and Diana regardless of their age, cultural difference, background.. anythings. no matter what, I believed because we share same reason to do, I knew that Nothing will let us fall down. 
</br></br>I had experiences of success and failure. From that, I learned sometime small things break a whole thing. I never wanted to ruin all I happened to be in. So first day, I said my self “I trust this team no matter what. My past experiences said this is different”. 
</br></br></br></br>
Now, I know I am in a situation to discuss about financial part. But In the meatime, I see the future on the article
</br></br> “Three women entrepreneur have world be healthier and provide jobs for men and women, old and young.. people who couldn’t re-start their life again… they empower people's life” </br></br>Because I know It is hard to find someone who can tear up together not because of the metarial but because of being a witness of "change the world”. 
</br></br></br></br>
Now at this point, as an women who head up to 30s after 2 yrs.
</br></br>
I want to take an action and spread out the fact that I am doing right things for me and for others. I know there are people who is willing to help anytime, anywhere and I know they are waiting.</br></br></br></br>
I know there are people who only pursue the money, who have high temper, who sometime don’t believe their team, who think himself is the best and I'm sure that you’ve met one of those in your life time. We know the outside of the world. Must face the fear.
</br></br></br></br>
Sorry for rambling but wanted to tell this at any point. Even If It won't go well, I will give it another shot till success. I hope we all do. But now at this moment, I am really happy to dream of it again</div>
